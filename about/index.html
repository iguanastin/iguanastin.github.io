				<h2>About Austin</h2>
				<p>A California-born Coloradoan living in Fort Collins for 20 years, Austin has broadly delved into a variety of interests and experiences. In adolescence, exploring and camping in the outdoors was king, especially as Austin became involved in Scouting. Through high school, though he continued in Scouts to the rank of Eagle Scout, Austin explored other interests, such as writing, illustration, and eventually FIRST Robotics with FRC team 159. Since then, his growing interest in computers and software development has led him to seek a degree in Computer Science at Colorado State University.</p>
				<p>During many of his school years, Austin experimented with programming languages and project ideas including application and video game development. Most recently, Android app development has caught a curious eye. <a href="../projects">See some of his projects here</a></p>
